# Memory-Test-Game

I have built a Memory Card Game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with React for creating interactive UI components. The game logic is written in modern ES6+ JavaScript, and JSX is used to structure React components inside the script. Babel is included to transpile JSX into regular JavaScript, making it compatible with the browser. The styling is done with CSS, and the game runs inside a simple HTML structure with a dynamic React-based rendering system.
